        <h2>A tribute to the liberator</h2>
        <p>Luís Gonzaga Pinto da Gama (Salvador, June 21, 1830 - São Paulo, August 24, 1882) was a Brazilian abolitionist, speaker, journalist, writer and is considered the country's Patron of the Abolition of Slavery.</p>
        <p>Born to a free black mother and white father, he was nevertheless made a slave at the age of 10 and remained illiterate until the age of 17. He conquered his freedom in court and started to act as a lawyer to enslaved black people. At 29 y.o. he was already an established author considered one of the greatest abolitionists in Brazil.</p>
        <p>Despite being considered one of the exponents of Brazilian literary romanticism, works such as Manuel Bandeira's "Presentation of Brazilian Poetry" do not even mention his name. As an author, he was emotional and captivating. Despite this, the historian Boris Fausto declared that he owned a soap opera biography.</p>
        <p>He was one of the rare black intellectuals in 19th century slave-centered Brazil, the only one who was entirely self-taught and who has been through the experience of captivity. His main objectives were the abolition of slavery and the end of the monarchy in Brazil. However, he died six years before the realization of these causes.</p>

          <h2>Childhood</h2>
          <p>Luiz Gonzaga Pinto da Gama was born in Salvador, Bahia, on June 21, 1830. He was the son of a white man (whose name he never mentioned) with the free black woman Luiza Mahin who, according to him, had participated in two of the largest slave revolts in Brazil: the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%AA_revolt" target="_blank">Malê Revolt</a> in 1835 and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabinada"> Sabinada</a> in 1837, and, as a consequence, had to flee to Rio de Janeiro, leaving Luís Gama in the care of his father.</p>
          <p>In 1840, at the age of 10, Luiz Gama was taken by his father to Rio de Janeiro and sold to the merchant and ensign Antônio Pereira Cardoso to pay a gambling debt. The fact that he was from Bahia, the slaves of which had a reputation for insubordination as a result of the mentioned revolts, the merchant was unable to resell him and eventually took him to his farm in the municipality of Limeira. At the age of 17, Luís met Antônio Rodrigues do Prado, a student who was a guest at the farm and taught him to read and write.</p>

          <h2>Law Studies and Freedom</h2>
          <p>In 1848, at the age of 18, knowing that his situation as a slave was illegal, since both his parents were free, Luís fled to the city of São Paulo. Later that year, he tried to enter the Largo de São Francisco Law School (one of only two in Brazil at the time), but because he was black, he was harassed by teachers and students and only allowed to attended classes as a listener.</p>
          <p>Even though he could not graduate from college, he acquired knowledge that allowed him to act in the legal defense of enslaved persons, as it was possible to act in court without being licensed as a lawyer at the time.</p>
          <p>The means Luís used to free himself are not well known. It's speculated that his father — whose identity he kept hidden for all his life — gave testimony on his behalf.</p>

          <h2>Liberator of the slaves</h2>
          <p>Acting in court on behalf of the slaves, Luiz Gama was known to have impeccable oratory and, with his legal knowledge, he managed to defended slaves who could purchase their freedom, but were prevented by their owners. He also defended the slaves who entered the national territory after the 1850 slave trade ban. He participated in secret societies, such as Freemasonry, which helped him financially. <strong>Through all his life, he managed to free more than 500 captives</strong>.</p>
          <p>On November 3, 2015, 133 years after Luís Gama's death, the Brazilian Bar Association, São Paulo Section, granted him the title of "lawyer", since he was an unlicenced defender during his life. The tribute ceremony, entitled "Luiz Gama: Ideas and Legacy of the Abolitionist Leader", featured two days of debates and lectures.</p>
          <p>The tribute is unprecedented in the history of the Brazilian Bar Association. According to its national President at the time, Marcus Vinicius Furtado Coêlho, <cite>"this was is a very just tribute to those who fought so hard for freedom, equality and respect"</cite>.</p>
